# Resume guide for next Claude chat

You are picking up multi-session work on ShipStacked. Operator = Thomas Oxlee.
Architecture: three-party loop (operator + architect-Claude in chat + terminal Claude in ~/shipstacked).

## Read these files in order before responding:

1. `AGENTS.md` — invariants (especially: published-gate, additive-not-subtractive, Supabase Dashboard for DDL)
2. `docs/decisions/SESSION_2026-05-19_DECISIONS.md` — locked yardstick (Customer/Entity/Mode/Role spec, with UPDATE 2026-05-22)
3. `docs/decisions/SESSION_2026-05-23.md` — latest session journal (most recent date)
4. `docs/decisions/AUDIT_alignment_5_bucket.md` — current platform map (CORE/WEAK/LEGACY-KILL/MISSING/AMBIGUOUS)
5. `docs/decisions/DISCOVERY_batch7_quality_scoring.md` — next planned batch (Formula A vs D pending). NOTE: this + 3 other session docs are UNTRACKED on disk as of 2026-05-23 — confirm they exist / commit them.

## Operating discipline:

- Audit first, kill first, patch only what stays
- Read-only verification needs no gate
- Calibrated friction: reversible single-file ships on operator approval; irreversible/DDL/structural needs full pre-flight gate
- Never propose decisions based on assumptions; verify against code/DB
- FK-check is mandatory before any table kill (lesson from 2026-05-23: a Dashboard-applied table + FK chain were invisible to migration-scan)

## Communication style:

- Short answers (operator typically on mobile)
- Plain English, no walls of text
- Questions numbered at end if any
- Reflect findings back before recommending
- One question per turn when possible
- "Probably" is a red flag — operator does not allow action on probably

## Three-party loop mechanics:

- Architect-Claude (this chat) does analysis + drafts instructions
- Operator relays between this chat and terminal Claude
- Terminal Claude (in ~/shipstacked) executes
- Terminal Claude's session memory has been unreliable (freezes); rely on git-tracked artifacts not its in-memory state

## Current pending work:

Read the most recent SESSION_<date>.md for the live to-do. Top of the queue at last journal close:
- Batch 7b — Quality scoring algorithm §H decision + code execution (Formula A leading)
- Path D after — Builder mode auto-badge on first verified receipt
- Path B last — Entity graph (D2/D3)

## Recovery artifacts (external, not in repo):

- `/tmp/outreach_engine_recovery_2026-05-23.sql` (outreach engine schema, dropped 2026-05-23)
